## Remote Work Journey

Remote work continued to be a cornerstone of my year. I collaborated with several innovative companies and saw immense growth in my professional skills. The highlight of my remote work journey was becoming a **Core Contributor for Celo Africa DAO** and leading impactful projects in blockchain technology.

Working with an incredible team of talented and supportive individuals across different time zones has been both challenging and rewarding. The flexibility remote work offers allowed me to balance my professional goals with personal projects seamlessly.

## Workshops and Hackathons

2024 was all about empowering developers and fostering innovation. I organized **Build with Celo Hackathons** monthly, with a focus on mobile blockchain applications. I also mentored aspiring developers through **Celo CodeJams** and bootcamps in Africa.

One memorable event was **ETHSafari**, where I gave a keynote on **The Future of Blockchain**. Sharing my journey and insights with the audience felt surreal, and the feedback I received was heartwarming.

## Personal Projects

### SaaS Product Progress üöÄ

Although I didn't officially launch my SaaS product, **Ventiqo**, significant strides were made. Ventiqo is an event management and ticketing platform utilizing blockchain technology. This project has been a learning curve, but I‚Äôm proud of the milestones we‚Äôve achieved, including:
- Developing a seamless subscription and billing system.
- Tokenizing events to introduce transparency in ticketing.

I look forward to launching Ventiqo in 2025!

## Personal Growth

### Health and Fitness üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This year, I prioritized my health. From hitting the gym regularly to following a balanced diet, I saw improvements in both my fitness levels and mental clarity. By the end of the year, I felt stronger, healthier, and more focused.

### Self-Reflection and Relationships üí¨

2024 was also a year of introspection. I spent time exploring the complexities of relationships and connections. These reflections inspired me to start my podcast, **Dust is Constant**, where I share thoughts on friendships, betrayal, and self-growth.

## Memorable Highlights

### Zanzibar Trip üå¥

A spontaneous trip to Zanzibar turned into one of the most memorable experiences of the year. Reconnecting with old friends, Valentine, made it even more special. It was a reminder of how important it is to step away from the hustle and cherish life‚Äôs little moments.

### Building a Home Office üñ•Ô∏è

With remote work being central to my routine, I upgraded my workspace. A new ergonomic setup, including a standing desk and ultrawide monitor, has transformed how I work.
