## **What is Code Jam?**

Code Jam is a programming competition in which contestants attempt to solve a set of computer programming problems in the shortest amount of time.

A Code Jam provides developers with an opportunity to practice their skills while winning rewards in the process.

Often the challenges are loosely based off real-world scenarios allowing developers to get a feel of how building on a client platform (Celo and other partners within the ecosystem) and in the real world, looks like. Think of them as online hackathons.

## Celo Code Jam

The Celo Code Jam is specially intended to assist web2 developers and blockchain enthusiasts looking to transition to web3. With a series of developer-focused activities and talks to help developers acquire new skills needed in the ecosystem to complete tasks that are project-focused and adhere to the agile methodology,

**The Aim of Celo Code Jams?**

The aim of Code Jams is to provide a fun and relaxed environment for coders to come together, socialise and compete in various coding challenges. The 3 major aims for Celo Code Jams Kenya are:

1.  To see how they think and solve problems.
2.  To challenge them to solve new and difficult problems
3.  To find the best programmers in the world.

**To see how they think and solve problems:** By watching how contestants solve problems, organizers can learn more about how they think and what techniques they use to solve problems. This can help organizers improve the quality of the problems in future code jams.

**To challenge them to solve new and difficult problems:** By presenting new and difficult problems to contestants, organizers can challenge them to push their limits and solve problems that they may not have solved before.

**To find the best programmers in the world:** Code jams attract top programmers from all over the world. By solving difficult problems in a short amount of time, contestants can show off their skills and demonstrate their ability to think quickly and creatively.
