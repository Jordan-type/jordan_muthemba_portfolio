Hello developers! 👋 Welcome to this week’s Clean Code Friday. 💻 Today, we’re going to look at a Solidity smart contract example called **Jokes** 🤡. We’ll explore how this contract works, discuss ways to write cleaner code ✨, and most importantly, improve it by preventing common vulnerabilities 🔒.

## Overview of the Contract

The **Jokes** contract is a Solidity-based smart contract that allows users to create jokes 😂, reward them 💰, and withdraw earnings 💵. Here is a quick summary of the functions:

*   **createJoke**: Allows users to create a new joke.
*   **rewardJoke**: Allows anyone to reward a joke with a set reward amount.
*   **withdrawBalance**: Let joke creators withdraw their earnings.
*   **deleteJoke**: Allows a joke creator to delete their joke.

Now, let’s discuss how to improve the quality of the code 🛠️ and address potential security vulnerabilities 🛡️.

## Improving Clean Code and Security

## 1\. Add Access Control for Sensitive Functions

Currently, anyone can call the **initializeRewards** function ⚠️. It’s important to add access control to ensure that only authorized users can modify these values 🔐.

**Improvement**:

*   Introduce a modifier like `onlyOwner` to restrict who can call **initializeRewards** 🔒.

```js
address public owner;  
  
modifier onlyOwner() {  
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");  
    \_;  
}  
  
constructor() {  
    owner = msg.sender;  
}  
  
function initializeRewards() public onlyOwner {  
    rewardAmounts\[1\] = CLASSIC\_REWARD;  
    rewardAmounts\[2\] = FUNNY\_REWARD;  
}
```

## 2\. Prevent Reentrancy Attacks

The **withdrawBalance** function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks ⚠️, where an attacker can re-enter the contract and withdraw multiple times before the state is updated.

**Improvement**:

*   Use the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern to prevent reentrancy 🔄.
*   Add a `reentrancyGuard` modifier.

```js
bool private locked;  
  
modifier reentrancyGuard() {  
    require(!locked, "Reentrancy detected!");  
    locked = true;  
    \_;  
    locked = false;  
}  
  
function withdrawBalance() public reentrancyGuard {  
    uint256 balance = creatorBalances\[msg.sender\];  
    require(balance > 0, "No balance to withdraw!");  
  
    creatorBalances\[msg.sender\] = 0;  
    (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");  
    require(success, "Failed to withdraw Ether balance");  
  
    emit BalanceWithdrawn(msg.sender, balance);  
}
```

## 3\. Gas Optimization

In Solidity, gas efficiency ⛽ is crucial. The **getJokes** function can be expensive 💸 since it loops through all jokes. To optimize gas usage: ⚡

**Improvement**:

*   Store an array of **non-deleted jokes** 📝 to avoid looping over all jokes each time.

```js
uint256\[\] public activeJokes;  
  
function createJoke(string memory \_setup, string memory \_punchline) public {  
    jokes\[numberOfJokes\] = Joke(\_setup, \_punchline, msg.sender, false);  
    activeJokes.push(numberOfJokes);  
    emit JokeCreated(numberOfJokes, msg.sender);  
    numberOfJokes++;  
}  
  
function deleteJoke(uint256 \_jokeId) public {  
    require(\_jokeId < numberOfJokes, "Invalid Joke ID or Index!");  
    require(jokes\[\_jokeId\].creatorAddress == msg.sender, "Only the joke creator can delete the joke!");  
    require(!jokes\[\_jokeId\].isDeleted, "Joke already removed!");  
  
    jokes\[\_jokeId\].isDeleted = true;  
    emit JokeDeleted(\_jokeId);  
}
```

By maintaining an `activeJokes` array, you can avoid looping through deleted jokes and instead provide a quick reference to all non-deleted jokes.

## 4\. Use `SafeMath` for Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations in Solidity, like addition, can result in **overflows** or **underflows** 💥. To prevent this, use **SafeMath** ✅.

**Improvement**:

*   Import OpenZeppelin’s **SafeMath** library for safer arithmetic operations.

```js
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";  
  
using SafeMath for uint256;  
  
function rewardJoke(uint256 \_jokeId, uint256 \_rewardType) public payable {  
    require(\_jokeId < numberOfJokes, "Invalid Joke ID OR Index!");  
    require(!jokes\[\_jokeId\].isDeleted, "Joke Removed!");  
    require(\_rewardType >= 1 && \_rewardType <= 2, "Reward type must be between 1 and 2!");  
  
    uint256 rewardAmount = rewardAmounts\[\_rewardType\];  
    require(msg.value == rewardAmount, "Incorrect reward amount!");  
  
    creatorBalances\[jokes\[\_jokeId\].creatorAddress\] = creatorBalances\[jokes\[\_jokeId\].creatorAddress\].add(rewardAmount);  
    emit JokeRewarded(\_jokeId, \_rewardType, rewardAmount);  
}
```

## 5\. Constructor for Initial Setup

The **initializeRewards** function is used to set initial reward values 🏆. Instead of relying on a function that anyone can call, this should be moved to the constructor 🏗️ to ensure it’s set during deployment.

**Improvement**:

*   Use a **constructor** to initialize reward values.

```js
constructor() {  
    owner = msg.sender;  
    rewardAmounts\[1\] = CLASSIC\_REWARD;  
    rewardAmounts\[2\] = FUNNY\_REWARD;  
}
```

## 6\. Explicit Error Messages

Providing explicit error messages helps both developers and users understand why a transaction failed 🚫. Solidity 0.8 introduced **custom errors**, which can save gas and provide more meaningful error descriptions.

**Improvement**:

*   Use **custom errors** for clearer error handling.

```js
error Unauthorized();  
error InvalidJokeId(uint256 jokeId);  
error InsufficientBalance();  
  
function deleteJoke(uint256 \_jokeId) public {  
    if (\_jokeId >= numberOfJokes) {  
        revert InvalidJokeId(\_jokeId);  
    }  
    if (jokes\[\_jokeId\].creatorAddress != msg.sender) {  
        revert Unauthorized();  
    }  
    require(!jokes\[\_jokeId\].isDeleted, "Joke already removed!");  
  
    jokes\[\_jokeId\].isDeleted = true;  
    emit JokeDeleted(\_jokeId);  
}
```

## Conclusion

Improving a smart contract isn’t just about adding new features 🌟, but also about refining its security 🔒, efficiency ⚡, and clarity 📝. By addressing reentrancy vulnerabilities, optimizing gas usage, adding access control, and using best practices like SafeMath, we can make our contracts safer and more maintainable.

That wraps up our Clean Code Friday for today! 🎉 Remember, keeping your code secure and clean is a continuous journey 🚀, so let’s keep improving one function at a time. 💪 Happy coding! 🚀👨‍💻👩‍💻
