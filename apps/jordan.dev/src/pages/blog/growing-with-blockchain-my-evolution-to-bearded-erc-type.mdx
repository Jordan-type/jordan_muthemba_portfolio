When I first started my internship, I felt like a fish out of water. I had only ever built my final project at university and had no experience working in a professional workspace or as part of a team. The team I joined was full of seasoned professionals with two to five years of experience, and I was the new guy trying to find my footing.

Despite my initial apprehension, I was eager to learn. My first significant task was developing a blockchain-based smart contract. This was a pivotal moment for me. Up until then, I had considered myself just an application developer. But working on that smart contract opened my eyes to the possibilities of blockchain technology and smart contracts. This task, assigned to me in 2018, not only challenged me but also set me on a new trajectory.

Over the next six months, I immersed myself in learning how to write secure smart contracts on Ethereum. It was a steep learning curve, but successfully creating a smart contract with no vulnerabilities was a turning point in my career.

## Campus Years

During my campus years, one of the most impactful pieces of advice I received came from my communication lecturer. They encouraged me to join a club or community to improve my communication skills. Taking this advice to heart, I joined the choir and drama club.

Participating in these activities not only honed my communication skills but also allowed me to make new friends across different disciplines on campus. These experiences were instrumental in building my confidence and shaping my ability to work in teams, which later became crucial during my internship and professional journey.

## The Lions of Mukoma

One of the most memorable and symbolic parts of my journey involved the Lions of Mukoma. Back then in Karen, Rongai, there were famous lions that occasionally wandered out of Nairobi National Park. My CEO often told us stories about these lions, and they became a symbol of fear and bravery for me.

As I started my path in the blockchain ecosystem in 2018, I often felt like I was facing those lions. The blockchain industry, particularly smart contract development, was still very new in Africa. There were few developers in this space, and I frequently questioned my place in it. I was afraid of making big steps and doubted whether I belonged in this innovative field.

Every time I traveled through Mukoma or headed towards Munderendu road, I was reminded of the lions and the fear they represented. I often wondered, what if the lions came out? What if they attacked me? This fear mirrored my anxieties about stepping into the unknown world of blockchain technology.

Despite my fears, I realized that being a pioneer in this space required courage. Just as I had to face the symbolic lions of Mukoma, I had to overcome my fears of entering the blockchain industry. I became one of the first to embrace smart contract development in Africa, turning my fears into a driving force for innovation and growth.

## The Villains of Our Story

One of the things I’ve always loved about comic books, particularly DC and Marvel, is the way they portray villains. Often, the hero and the villain share a common origin story. Take Batman and the Joker, for example — they both experienced significant trauma and loss, yet their paths diverged dramatically. Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of his parents, channeling his grief into becoming Batman, a symbol of justice. Conversely, the Joker, often depicted as a failed comedian who suffered a series of unfortunate events, transformed his pain into madness and became a symbol of chaos.

In Marvel, we see a similar dynamic with Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. Peter Parker and Norman Osborn both grapple with personal loss and the responsibilities their abilities impose. Peter chooses to use his powers to protect and serve, guided by the principle that “with great power comes great responsibility.” In stark contrast, Norman Osborn’s quest for power and control leads him down the path of villainy, becoming Spider-Man’s nemesis, the Green Goblin.

Similarly, in the animated world, the story of Megamind and Metro Man illustrates this concept. Both were orphans sent away from their dying planets and ended up on Earth. While Metro Man was raised in a loving environment and became a hero, Megamind was raised in a prison and grew up to be a villain. Despite their similar beginnings, their paths diverged based on their environments and choices, highlighting how circumstances and decisions shape who we become.

In my journey, I’ve encountered my own ‘villains.’ These aren’t people, but rather the challenges and obstacles that make innovation difficult. The noise of differing opinions, the skepticism of new ideas, and the resistance to change can feel overwhelming. Yet, just like in the comics, these ‘villains’ often share a common origin with the ‘heroes’ of innovation. We all start from a place of curiosity and a desire to create something better.

Understanding this shared origin helps me see these challenges not as insurmountable obstacles, but as part of the journey. They push me to think more creatively and to find new ways to overcome the hurdles in the blockchain industry. In the end, the villains of our story are just as crucial as the heroes in shaping who we become.

## Meeting Beautiful Minds

Fast forward to 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I took some significant steps in my career. The pandemic brought many challenges, but it also opened up new opportunities for virtual collaboration and competition. I began participating in international hackathons and found great success, winning events like ETH Denver and ETH India.

These hackathons were more than just competitions; they were opportunities to meet and collaborate with brilliant minds from around the world. Inspired by John Nash’s ‘A Beautiful Mind,’ I saw these events as a way to connect with others who shared my passion for blockchain technology and innovation.

In addition to competing, I also became a mentor on DevFolio. I guided developers on how to build decentralized applications on Celo, sharing my knowledge and helping others navigate the complexities of smart contract development. This experience was incredibly rewarding and reinforced my commitment to fostering a vibrant blockchain community.

## Pragmatic Builders in Kenya and Beyond

After my successes in 2020, I dedicated myself to training and mentoring the next generation of developers in Africa. Through Celo and other companies, I have hosted several bootcamps where I have met talented developers from Kenya, Nigeria, Cameroon, South Africa and India. These experiences highlight the incredible potential and diversity within the African tech community.

As pragmatic builders, we have focused on practical solutions that address real-world problems. This approach resonates deeply with the developers I have worked with. They are eager to learn, innovate, and create technologies that can make a tangible impact on their communities.

The dynamics of the builders’ community in Africa have grown significantly. I’ve seen a surge in interest and participation, driven by a collective desire to solve pressing issues and improve lives through technology. This pragmatic approach to building has fostered a vibrant and resilient community, ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow in Africa.

## Translating Knowledge: From Theory to Real-World Applications

One of the critical aspects of effective problem-solving is the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical applications. This process is vital in the tech industry, where innovations often start as abstract ideas in research papers and eventually become tangible products that impact our daily lives.

During my time training developers, I emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between academic knowledge and real-world applications. This concept is akin to the journey from scientific research to practical engineering solutions. For instance, breakthroughs in quantum theory have led to advancements in cryptography, which are now integral to blockchain technology.

In the blockchain space, developers and engineers play a crucial role in turning theoretical concepts into functional applications. Without their expertise, many groundbreaking ideas would remain purely academic and never benefit society. This brings us back to the idea of noise in the communication channel. If developers and engineers are not integrated into the process of translating knowledge, there is a risk that the innovation will be misinterpreted or fail to address real-world needs effectively. The noise here represents the potential disconnect between research and practical application.

Therefore, placing developers and engineers at the center of this translation process ensures that the knowledge generated is not only understood but also applied in ways that make a meaningful impact. This approach helps create solutions that are both innovative and practical, directly addressing the needs of the community.

## Personal Growth

Personal growth has been a continuous journey for me, shaped by numerous learning opportunities and experiences. Early this year, I joined the ZK Bootcamp hosted by ENCODE. This experience has been instrumental in broadening my perspective on the future of blockchain technology, particularly in the realm of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

The bootcamp delved deep into the intricacies of ZKPs, a groundbreaking area in blockchain that promises to revolutionize how we approach security and privacy. Through this intensive program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how ZKPs can be leveraged to enhance security, ensure privacy, and create more efficient and scalable blockchain solutions.

As part of the capstone project for the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to team up with Allan Mageni, a fellow participant. Together, we developed a zero-knowledge proof lending protocol using the Mina blockchain. This project not only allowed me to apply what I had learned but also demonstrated the practical applications of ZKPs in the field of decentralized finance.

## Impact Stories: Mentoring and Community Building

Throughout my journey, I’ve had the privilege of being deeply involved in the Celo Kenya community for developers. This engagement has been a cornerstone of my career, allowing me to give back and help shape the next generation of blockchain developers.

One of the key initiatives I’ve participated in is hosting monthly Code Jams. These events have provided a platform for developers to come together, learn, and collaborate on various projects. The consistent monthly gatherings have fostered a strong sense of community and continuous learning among participants.

Currently, Celo Kenya is an integral part of the Celo Africa DAO. In my role as a developer trainer, I’ve been able to extend my mentorship to a wider audience across Africa. This has included helping seasoned developers expand their skills within the Web3 space, particularly focusing on the Ethereum blockchain.

In addition to my work with Celo, I’ve also conducted training sessions on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Last year, we hosted several hackathons, which were instrumental in providing hands-on experience and encouraging innovative solutions among the participants. I also facilitated Web3 clubs and collaborated with BitKE for the Ethereum cohort, further enriching the learning experience for developers.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I had the opportunity to attend a bootcamp that was pivotal in my learning journey. This bootcamp introduced me to active pedagogy, a teaching method that emphasizes student engagement, participation, and hands-on learning. This approach significantly enhanced my teaching and mentoring skills.

At this bootcamp, I met several remarkable individuals, including Alex Thuo, Rachel Chege, David Warui, Valentine Waithera, Silikhe Sil, Ken Nyaga, Micheni Brenda, Edith Kesa, Mwiti and others. These connections have been invaluable, fostering collaborations and friendships that have endured beyond the bootcamp.

## Call to Action

As I reflect on my journey over the past 6 years, I’m filled with gratitude for the experiences and opportunities that have shaped me. From my early days as an intern to my current role as a mentor and community builder, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of blockchain technology.

But this journey is far from over. The blockchain landscape is constantly evolving, and there are always new challenges to tackle and opportunities to explore. As we move forward, I encourage fellow developers and innovators to embrace the unknown, face their fears, and continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Together, we can build a future where blockchain technology is a driving force for positive change, creating solutions that improve lives and empower communities around the world. Let’s continue to learn, innovate, and grow — because the best is yet to come.
