Walking back into the picturesque grounds of Moi University, a rush of nostalgia hit me. I recalled my first days as an eager freshman and the proud moment when I donned the cap and gown as a graduate. But this time, my return to Moi University held a different significance. I was here not just as an alumnus, but as a mentor, ready to introduce the next generation to the revolutionary world of the Celo blockchain and Opera’s product, Minipay.

**A Changed Landscape, A Familiar Passion**

While the campus infrastructure had seen changes, some buildings boasting fresh coats of paint and new additions, the spirit of the student body was the same. Energetic, enthusiastic, and keen to make an impact in the world. This was the energy I was eager to tap into.

**Embracing the Future with Celo and Minipay**

The world of software development is vast, but my focus this time was specific: The Celo blockchain. Celo, an open platform that makes financial tools accessible to anyone with a mobile phone, is making waves in the tech industry. And building on top of this platform is Minipay, a product by Opera, designed to further simplify transactions and make them more accessible.

These advancements resonate with the ethos of Moi University: to be at the forefront of innovation. Introducing these young professionals to Celo and Minipay was not just about teaching them a new technology; it was about showing them the future of decentralized finance.

**Beyond Code: Understanding the Impact**

While we delved deep into the technical aspects, understanding the nuances of the Celo blockchain, and the functionality of Minipay, our discussions often veered into the impact of these technologies. Decentralized finance promises to democratize access to financial tools, especially in regions where traditional banking has limitations.

**The Challenges of a New Frontier**

Adopting new technologies is never without its challenges. The students, while brilliant, sometimes grappled with understanding the intricacies of blockchain. But with every hurdle, came an opportunity to learn and grow. Their determination reminded me of my days at the university, always striving to conquer the next challenge.

**Networking in the Blockchain Era**

I emphasized the importance of networking, especially in the fast-evolving world of blockchain. Moi University, with its diverse talent pool, is a fertile ground for collaboration. I encouraged them to share ideas, brainstorm, and most importantly, envision how they can shape the future with tools like Celo and Minipay.

**Conclusion**

As the training sessions concluded, I was filled with a profound sense of fulfilment. To be able to give back to Moi University, introducing the next wave of software developers to cutting-edge technologies, was a cherished experience. The world stands at the cusp of a blockchain revolution, and I am confident that the seeds sown during these sessions will bear fruit in the form of innovations, startups, and breakthroughs in the coming years. The legacy of Moi University as a cradle of excellence continues, and I am proud to be a part of it.
