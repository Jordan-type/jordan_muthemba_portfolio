In this comprehensive guide, we explore the process of transferring Circle’s USDC tokens on the Celo Alfajores testnet. Aimed at developers and blockchain enthusiasts, this article provides a detailed walkthrough of executing token transfers using the ethers.js library. Whether you’re embarking on your blockchain journey or looking to refine your development skills, this guide serves as a practical resource for engaging with blockchain technologies.

### Introduction to Celo Alfajores Testnet

The Celo Alfajores testnet is a dynamic environment designed for developers to test and build applications on the Celo platform without incurring the costs of the main network. It offers a sandbox for deploying contracts, executing transactions, and experimenting with the Celo blockchain’s capabilities.

### Prerequisites

\- Node.js installed on your system  
\- Access to a code editor  
\- ethers.js library installed in your project (Install via \`npm install ethers\` if not already done)

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Begin by importing the ethers.js library to your project:

```
  
const ethers = require('ethers');  

```

Define the RPC URL for connecting to the Celo Alfajores testnet:

```
  
const rpcUrl = 'https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org';  

```

Step 2: Connecting to the Network

Create a provider to facilitate the connection to the Celo testnet:

```
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);
```

Step 3: Setting Up the USDC Token Contract

Identify and set up the USDC token contract address and ABI for interactions:

```
const usdcTokenAddress = '0x2F25deB3848C207fc8E0c34035B3Ba7fC157602B';  
const minTokenAbi = \[…\];
```

### Step 4: Preparing for the Transfer

Specify the sender and receiver addresses and the sender’s private key. Use placeholders for actual values to maintain security:

```
const fromAddress = 'YOUR\_FROM\_ADDRESS';  
const toAddress = 'YOUR\_TO\_ADDRESS';  
const privatekey = 'YOUR\_PRIVATE\_KEY';  
const amount = 1; // Number of USDC tokens to transfer
```

Initialize the wallet and contract instances using the provided details:

```
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privatekey, provider);  
const contract = new ethers.Contract(usdcTokenAddress, minTokenAbi, wallet);
```

### Step 5: Executing the Transfer

1\. Calculate the Transaction Amount: Convert the USDC amount to the smallest unit using the contract’s \`decimals\` which is 6 property:

```
const decimals = await contract.decimals();  
const amountParsed = ethers.utils.parseUnits(amount.toString(), decimals);
```

2\. Check Sender’s Balance: Ensure the sender has sufficient USDC for the transfer:

```
const balance = await contract.balanceOf(fromAddress);  
 console.log("Balance of Sender Before Transfer: ", ethers.utils.formatUnits(balance.toString(), decimals));  
 if (balance.lt(amountParsed)) {  
 throw new Error('Insufficient balance');  
 }
```

3\. Initiate the Transfer: Call the \`transfer\` method with the recipient’s address and the amount:

```
let tx = await contract.transfer(toAddress, amountParsed);
```

4\. Confirm the Transaction: Wait for the transaction to be mined and retrieve the receipt:

```
let receipt = await tx.wait();  
let url = \`https://alfajores.celoscan.io/tx/${receipt.transactionHash}\`;  
 console.log(\`Transaction ${receipt.transactionHash} confirmed, check it out at ${url}\`);
```

5\. Verify Balances: Confirm the transfer by checking both sender’s and receiver’s balances post-transaction:

```
// Sender's balance after transfer  
 const balanceAfter = await contract.balanceOf(fromAddress);  
 console.log("Balance of Sender After Transfer: ", ethers.utils.formatUnits(balanceAfter.toString(), decimals));  
// Receiver's balance after transfer  
 const balanceAfterReceiver = await contract.balanceOf(toAddress);  
 console.log("Balance of Receiver After Transfer: ", ethers.utils.formatUnits(balanceAfterReceiver.toString(), decimals));
```
