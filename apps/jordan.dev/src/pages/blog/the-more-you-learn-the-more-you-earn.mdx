I will start with a quote from one of the greatest and richest man in the world

“The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself… The more you learn, the more you’ll earn.”

\-Warren Buffett-

To relate to this, mid-2019 I took a 2-month python course at Tech Camp Kenya at the time I felt like I was wasting my resources and time. Little did I know that my new-found skill was preparing me for the future.

It is hard sometimes to find time to learn something new, which is not urgent at the time. More so while balancing work and quality time with friends, if you do sure like to party. The first few weeks I hesitated and felt like dropping out. However, I remembered I had started an investment journey on myself, and as an investor, you do not get to profit immediately.

If I delayed, dark days would have caught up with me during this pandemic. While we were introducing ourselves during the boot camp, our instructor asked us the reason as to why we wanted to learn python.

Most stated that they wanted to upskill themselves, which meet if they delayed their chances of losing the job was increasing.

For me I had a different reason, which was still valid. Having landed a Job in a startup that encouraged me to learn new technologies like blockchain. I had more and enough reasons not to drop out of the boot camp.

It is a fact that the more you learn the more you earn. However, it does not necessary mean money. When you learn, you earning knowledge and skills. Two years after graduating university whatever I had learnt at campus was obsolete in this rapidly changing field of technology. This means **as the futurist Alvin Toffler wrote**: “ _The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn._ “ I have to keep updating my self with the current trends in technology and other related fields.

**Conclusion**

To be frank, there are no safe jobs anymore. This pandemic has proven so. The Idea is to learn a new skill that will make you relevant in future and at the same time double your lifetime earnings.
