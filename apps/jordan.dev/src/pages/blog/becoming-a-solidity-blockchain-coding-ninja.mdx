This is an expedition not of self-discovery but a marathon of a learning experience in blockchain and emerging technology. I have had my fair share of surprises, and if you were anything like me when I started out with programming, you would need this advice.

“Never feel bad about failing.” And” Persistence is the key to _becoming_ a better coder”

That is what my Grandma tells me. As we embark on this marathon of becoming a **blockchain developer,** as is the name, give to someone who builds on a blockchain. When someone mentions blockchain, what comes first in your mind is cryptocurrencies. All cryptocurrencies are built on what is known as **_Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)_,** and blockchain is the most popular form of it. Most cryptocurrencies based on the Ethereum platforms/blockchain are created using a language known as Solidity. For anyone who wants to learn how to cook Grandma’s pie, you must know the recipe.

This also applies to anyone who wants to learn how to make Smart Contracts (ERCs Tokens), DAPPs (Decentralized Applications) or get into the ICO game, learning Solidity is an absolute must. Solidity is easy but if you have no experience in any programming language, it can be overwhelming for starts since solidity is a blend of C++, Python, and JavaScript. One must-have the basics of either two of the above languages to master solidity.

## Development Tools

Ethereum has a large and growing number of tools to help developers build, test, and deploy their applications. Ethereum has a lot of setups. Moreover, I think this turns off most developers like myself. Solidity — the most popular language on Ethereum, inspired by C++, Python, and JavaScript IPFS — InterPlanetary File System is a decentralized storage and file referencing system for Ethereum.

## Cool stuff

1.  **Smart Contracts —** is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract). Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. **ERC Token Standards**. ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments) are technical documents used by smart contract developers at Ethereum. E.g. **ERC20, ERC721, ERC223, ERC-777 (and ERC-820) Standard.**
2.  **DAPPS —** a computer [application that runs on a distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) system. DApps have been popularized by [distributed ledger technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) (DLT) such as the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), where DApps are often referred to as [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract).
3.  **DAOs — Decentralized Autonomous Organization** (**DAO**), sometimes labeled a **decentralized autonomous corporation** (**DAC**), or **decentralized autonomous nonprofit organization** DANO is an [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by shareholders and not influenced by a central government.
4.  Crypto Games are video games with a fully or partially distributed ledger architecture that operate on top of a cryptocurrency/network, giving players provable ownership over the virtual. goods they contain. This also allows players to exchange **(**[Cryptokitties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptokitties), Cryptoflowers **popular based on the ethereum platform ).**

## Conclusion

1.  As the Blockchain technology continues to evolve, so will its professional opportunities.
2.  The Blockchain is here with us to stay which means that Blockchain Expertise is to be in high demand for years and years to come.
3.  So whether you are a techie or not, a career in Blockchain is a new and exciting opportunity worth exploring.
